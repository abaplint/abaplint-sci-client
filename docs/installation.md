# Installation

## Prerequisites

- ABAP Application Server 7.31 or higher
  (Potentially works with 702 though downported json xml parser should be available)
- [abaplint Server](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint-sci-server)

## Dependencies

The following repositories must be installed in this order:

- [abapGit developer version](https://docs.abapgit.org/guide-install.html#install-developer-version)
  (with all the separate classes, not a simple file version)
- [abaplint Client](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint-sci-client) (this repo)

## Initial Setup

1. Test Management

Activate the abaplint check in transaction `SCI`

From the main menu choose Code Inspector -> Management of -> Tests

2. Check Variant

In transaction `SCI`, create a new test variant. Note: If you want to use the variant within abapGit, it has to be a global variant (icon with two users).

Select the abaplint check and use the arrow icon to jump to the abaplint configuration.

abaplint needs general configuration and settings that are defined per SAP package

3. General Configuration

Select 'Configuration' and maintain the connection to your [abaplint Server](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint-sci-server).

Optional parameters:

- Dependency depth - Defines over how many levels the check will try to resolve dependencies of ABAP classes (via inheritance, interfaces, attributes, or types)
- Continue into SAP objects - Decides if dependencies of SAP objects should be included in the check
- Use cache - Select if dependencies and serialized files shall be cache in transparent tables
- HTTP timeout - Setting for HTTP connection to abaplint SCI server
- SSL ID - Setting for HTTP connection (default ANONYM)

4. Package Configuration

You have to maintain the abaplint configuration for SAP package level. The configuration for a given package will also cover all subpackages and their objects.
Select 'Add package', add the configuration, and save it.

You can retrieve either the default configuration which includes all rules supported by your abaplint server using 'Update with Default'. If your package is
linked to an abapGit repository, then you can use 'Update from abapGit' to get the content of the abaplint.json file as a basis for your configuration.

## Important Notes

1. General as well as package configurations will be valid for _all_ check variants that enable the abaplint checks. They are not check variant-specific.

2. The abaplint check configuration (json) is _independent_ of the abaplint.json file in your repository. They can be different (although they probably shouldn't be).

3. **Remember to save all changes to configuration and check variant.**

## Cross-References

The abaplint check depends on the cross-reference generated automatically by your SAP system (for customer objects).

In case it you think there is an issue, run these reports in background:

- SAPRSEUB for SAP objects (**Note:** This will require several GB of space in your database)
- SAPRSEUC for Customer objects (Y*/Z*)

Also to ensure that the repository is kept clean, run SAPRSEUJ which schedules the required jobs.
